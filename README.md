This Android application helps us preserve democracy in the country, since it asks citizens questions on issues that the government proposes. This creates a popular consensus.
This application uses APIs so it prevents hackers. The goverment ask citizens and they can respond through API's as well.

Each citizen has to register to enter the application. After this you will enter a question box which you can answer and if you have already answered, you can see the percentage of each question.

In order to improve this application we could connect with the Reniec database and thus be able to verify each person.
